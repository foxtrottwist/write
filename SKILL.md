description: Written communication with quality standards. Handles message composition (emails, texts, notes), proofreading, and professional content creation. Supports saving reusable snippets for future use. Triggers on "write", "compose", "draft", "proofread", "fix grammar", "help me say", "save this phrase", or requests to create professional content.

# Writing

Written communication following quality standards. Three paths based on task complexity.

## Resume Check

Every invocation, check for existing state in `.writing.local/`.

**If state exists**, read `state.json` and use **AskUserQuestion** to offer resume or start fresh — include the content type and current phase as context so the user knows what they're resuming.

**If no state**, proceed to Discover.

## Discover

Infer path from request language:
- "proofread", "fix grammar", "check this" → **Proofread**
- "email", "text", "note", "message", "reply" → **Compose Message**
- "LinkedIn", "cover letter", "blog", "bio", "article" → **Create Content**

Infer tone from relationship context (professional, colleague, casual). Use **AskUserQuestion** only when path or tone is genuinely ambiguous — for example, "help me write something about my experience" could be a LinkedIn post, cover letter, or blog. Present the likely options with brief descriptions.

## Path: Compose Message

**Single-shot**. See [references/templates.md](references/templates.md) for input structure.

1. Gather: type, relationship, intent, key points
2. Apply writing standards from [references/standards.md](references/standards.md)
3. Use appropriate snippets from [references/snippets.md](references/snippets.md) when applicable
4. Output: Ready-to-send message only

If the user provides partial context (e.g., "write an email to my manager" without specifying intent), infer from context when possible. Use **AskUserQuestion** for missing critical details — intent and key points — that can't be reasonably inferred. Combine into a single question with multiSelect when asking about multiple facets.

**No commentary, no alternatives.** Just the message.

## Path: Proofread

**Single-shot**. Minimal intervention.

1. Identify errors (spelling, grammar, punctuation)
2. Preserve original voice and formatting
3. Never alter quoted material
4. Output: Corrected text only

**Success**: All errors fixed, voice preserved, ready for use.

## Path: Create Content (Iterative)

For longer professional content, use iterative refinement.

### Workflow
```
DISCOVER → DRAFT → REFINE → VALIDATE
```

### Phase: Draft
Create initial version applying:
- Writing standards (prohibited terms, voice requirements)
- Context-specific tone (professional, technical, educational)
- Structure appropriate to content type

Write to `.writing.local/{slug}/draft.md`

### Phase: Refine
Present draft and use **AskUserQuestion** to gather structured feedback:
- Options like "Adjust tone", "Restructure", "Add detail", "Shorten" help focus revision rounds
- Always include a freeform "Other" option for specific feedback

Per feedback round:
1. Apply changes
2. Log in `feedback.md`:
```markdown
## Round {N}
**Feedback:** {what user said}
**Changes:** {what changed}
```
3. Update draft
4. Present updated version — repeat until user signals done

### Phase: Validate
Check against standards:
- [ ] No prohibited terms
- [ ] Authentic voice (not marketing)
- [ ] Claims backed by specifics
- [ ] Meets 2 of 3: actionable, evidence-based, problem-solving

Present final version.

## State Files (Iterative Only)

```
.writing.local/{slug}/
├── state.json      # Current phase
├── brief.md        # Requirements
├── draft.md        # Current version
├── feedback.md     # Revision history
└── guardrails.md   # Lessons learned
```

## Saving Snippets

When user requests to save copy for reuse ("save this", "remember this phrase", "store for later"):

1. Identify appropriate category in [references/snippets.md](references/snippets.md)
2. If category is unclear, use **AskUserQuestion** to let user pick from existing categories or create a new one
3. Add the snippet under that category
4. Confirm what was saved and where

**Trigger phrases:**
- "Save this for later"
- "Remember this response"
- "Add to my snippets"
- "Store this phrase"

## Guardrails

Append discoveries to `guardrails.md`:

```markdown
## {Pattern}
- **Context:** {when this applies}
- **Problem:** {what went wrong}
- **Fix:** {how to avoid}
```
