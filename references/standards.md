# Writing Standards

## Voice Constraints

**Required:**
- Authentic conversational tone (direct, honest)
- Technical precision without jargon
- Specific examples over abstract claims
- Question-driven engagement

**Prohibited terms** (replace immediately):
- "crafting" → building, creating
- "drove/championed" → led, implemented
- "elegant/performant" → clean, efficient
- "passionate/innovative" → show through examples
- "leverage/seamless/robust" → use, apply, works well

## Success Criteria

Content must include 2 of 3:
- **Actionable**: Specific tools/methods readers can implement
- **Evidence-based**: Personal testing results or quantified outcomes
- **Problem-solving**: Address real challenges with tested solutions

**Quality gates:**
- Sounds like authentic conversation, not marketing
- All claims backed by specific examples
- Technical accuracy verified
- Accessible to intended audience

## Context-Specific Voice

### Professional (LinkedIn, cover letters)
```
tone: confident but honest
structure: problem → solution → result
evidence: specific metrics and timelines
```

### Technical (documentation, code comments)
```
tone: methodical and clear
structure: context → approach → lessons learned
evidence: code examples and performance data
```

### Educational (blog, tutorials)
```
tone: conversational and empowering
structure: challenge → exploration → recommendations
evidence: personal journey with practical takeaways
```

**Key elements:** Direct questions, honest uncertainty, conversational flow
